    MODULES FUNCTIONAL DETAILS:

    This module is used to perform the read status function
    for the ip236 board.  A pointer to the Configuration Block will
    be passed to this routine.  The routine will use a pointer
    within the Configuration Block together with offsets
    to reference the registers on the Board and will transfer the 
    status information from the Board to the Configuration Block.
