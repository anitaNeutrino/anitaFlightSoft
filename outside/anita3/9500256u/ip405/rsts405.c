    MODULES FUNCTIONAL DETAILS:

    This module is used to perform the read status function for the ip405
    board.  A pointer to the Status Block will be passed to this routine.
    The routine will use a pointer within the Status Block together with
    offsets to reference the registers on the Board and will transfer the 
    status information from the Board to the Status Block.
