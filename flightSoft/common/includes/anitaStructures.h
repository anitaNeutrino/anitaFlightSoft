/*! \file anitaStructures.h
    \brief Contains the definitions of all the structures used to store 
    and move ANITA data and stuff.
    
    Some simple definitions of the structures that we'll use to store 
    ANITA data. In here there will be the structures used for transient data,
    housekeeping stuff, GPS stuff and anything else that is going to be used
    by more than one of the processes. This will all change to use bit fields,
    at some point in the future. For now this is just a place holder we can
    test data flow with.
