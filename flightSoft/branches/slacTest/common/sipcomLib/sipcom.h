/*
 * Function: sipcom_init
 *   	Initializes SIP communications.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   	- Initializes the serial ports for COMM1, COMM2, and high rate
 *   	  TDRSS data.
 *   	- Initializes the SIP throttling module.
 *   	- Starts two threads that read input from COMM1 and COMM2.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	throttle_rate - maximum number of bytes/sec to write to SIP.
 * 	See <sipcom_highrate_set_throttle> for an important warning on
 * 	the value of the throttle rate.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	0 - all went well
 *	< 0 - there were problems, in which case, use <sipcom_strerror> to
 *	retrieve a hopefully meaningful error message.
 *
 * See also:
 * 	- <sipcom_reset>
 * 	- <sipcom_highrate_set_throttle> for IMPORTANT WARNING!

 * Function: sipcom_end

 * Description:
 *	This function causes sipcom_wait() to stop waiting and to terminate
 *	the two SIP input reading threads. If sipcom_wait() has not been
 *	called, then sipcom will not terminate.
 *
 * See also:
 * 	- <sipcom_init>

 *     pointer).

 * 	Wait for sipcom_end to tell us to stop waiting and then terminate
 *	the two reader threads.
 *
 * Description:
 * 	Recall that <sipcom_init> starts two threads (one to read input
 * 	from the SIP on port COMM1 and one on port COMM2). <sipcom_wait>
 * 	will block until <sipcom_end> signals that it is time to quit; then
 * 	both of these threads will be cancelled. It should be called at the
 * 	point in your program where you want to turn control over to
 * 	sipcom.

 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 	Ordinarily, <sipcom_init> should only be run once.
 * 	If it becomes necessary to run <sipcom_init> more than once, this
 * 	function <sipcom_reset> must be run first. Note that before doing
 * 	that, you should make sure that the two SIP reader threads have
 * 	terminated (by having called sipcom_wait() and then sipcom_end()).

 * Function: sipcom_highrate_write
 * 	Write data to the SIP high rate TDRSS port.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 	Use this function to write data to the high rate TDRSS port. This
 * 	function takes care of throttling the rate at which we write to the
 * 	SIP. All the requested bytes should be written to the SIP without
 * 	exceeding the throttle rate specified in <sipcom_init> or
 * 	<sipcom_highrate_set_throttle>.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	buf - pointer to data to be written
 * 	nbytes - number of bytes to write. There is no limit to the number
 * 		of bytes to write, but I wouldn't exceed the throttle rate
 * 		by too much.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	0 - all went well
 *	< 0 - there were problems, in which case, use <sipcom_strerror> to
 *		retrieve a hopefully meaningful error message.

/*
 * Function: sipcom_highrate_set_throttle
 * 	Change the maximum rate at which we write high rate data to SIP
 *
 * Description:
 * 	Use this function to change to maximum rate (in bytes/sec). It
 * 	should have been originally set in the <sipcom_init> call.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * 	As of Summer, 2005, the SIP can sustain a maximum rate of about
 * 	6,000 bits/second or 750 bytes/second. If this rate is exceeded for
 * 	more than a few seconds, the SIP's buffers will overflow and data
 * 	WILL BE LOST! To be on the safe side, I recommend not exceeding
 * 	about 5500 bits/second, or about 688 bytes/second. Furthermore, the
 * 	NSBF engineers may set the rate lower than the maximum, in which
 * 	case, you should set the throttle rate to be less than that.
 * 	Hopefully, the NSBF will let you know about this situation, but you
 * 	should nevertheless perform checks on the received data to make
 * 	sure that buffers are not being dropped.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	rate - maximum number of bytes/sec to write to SIP
 *
 * See also:
 * 	- <sipcom_init>
 * 	- <sipcom_highrate_write>

 * 	Call this function to pass the library a pointer to your function
 * 	that will be used to process each command received from the ground.
 * 	Each time a command is parsed on either the <COMM1> or <COMM2>
 * 	ports, your function will be executed and provided with a buffer
 * 	containing the command bytes.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	f - pointer to callback function f

/*
 * Function: sipcom_set_cmd_length
 * 	Specify length of each ground command.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 	In order to parse incoming ground commands, the sipcom library must
 * 	know the value of the first byte of each command (its ID) and the
 * 	length in bytes of the command. The length includes the ID byte.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	id - the unique first byte that identifies this command.
 * 	length - length in bytes of this command, including the ID byte.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - Maybe it should not return a value?

/*
 * Function: sipcom_slowrate_write
 * 	Write data to a slow rate port.
 *
 * Description:
 * 	
 * 	Use this function to write data to one of the slow rate ports. Note
 * 	that a maximum of 240 bytes can be written with this function. It
 * 	should be called inside your <slowrate_callback> function, as the
 * 	SIP won't accept slow rate data until after it requests the data.
 * 	These data requests typically occur every 30 seconds.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	comm - which slow rate port to use. Should be either the macro
 *		<COMM1> or <COMM2>. Usually, one port sends the data via
 *		TDRSS and the other IRIDIUM.
 * 	buf - the bytes to send.
 * 	nbytes - number of bytes to send. Maximum of 240 bytes.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - all went well.
 * 	< 0 - there were problems, in which case, use <sipcom_strerror> to
 * 	retrieve a hopefully meaningful error message.

 * See also:

/*
 * Function: sipcom_set_slowrate_callback
 * 	Specify the slowrate data callback function.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 	Call this function to pass the library a pointer to your function
 * 	that will be called when we get a data request from the SIP. These
 * 	requests indicate that the SIP is ready to receive more slow rate
 * 	data. Each time the data request is received on a particular port,
 * 	the callback for that port is executed. The callback should write
 * 	the data to that same port using <sipcom_slowrate_write>.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	comm - which slow rate port to use. Should be either the macro
 *		<COMM1> or <COMM2>. Usually, one port sends the data via
 *		TDRSS and the other IRIDIUM.
 *
 *	 f - a pointer to your <slowrate_callback> function.
