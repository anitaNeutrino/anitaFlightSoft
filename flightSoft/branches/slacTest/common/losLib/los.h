/*
 * Function: los_init
 * 	Initializes LOS telemetry communications.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 	- Attempts to "open" the Washington U LOS telemetry board.
 * 	- Does an <los_reset()>.
 * 	- Checks that board memory address 0 has the correct value. If the
 * 	value is incorrect, this is not a WU telemetry board.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	bus - PCI bus that the telemetry board should be in.
 * 	slot - slot the board should be in.
 * 	intr - if nonzero, use interrupts, else poll if okay to read/write
 * 	wr - if nonzero, we are writing data, else reading
 * 	ms - number of ms to delay between polls. Use -1 to accept default
 * 	     of 100 ms.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - all went well
 * 	-1 - could not open device
 * 	-2 - bad read of address 0
 * 	-3 - address 0 has incorrect value
 * 	-4 - couldn't set up interrupt
 *
 * See also:
 * 	<los_strerror> for error messages if all did not go well.

 * 	- "Closes" the board.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - all went well
 * 	-1 - error disabling interrupt
 * 	-2 - error closing device

 *
 * Description:

 * 	<los_init>.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * 	buf - pointer to array of bytes to write as data
 * 	nbytes - number of bytes to write (maximum = <LOS_MAX_BYTES>)
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - all went well
 * 	-1 - nbytes was too big
 * 	-2 - wait for board interrupt timed out or failed
 * 	-3 - write to board failed
 * 	-4 - not initialized for writing
 * 	-5 - poll for DATA_READY timed out

 * Parameters:
 *
 * 	buf - pointer to array of bytes to read to (should be at least
 * 	    8192 bytes long).
 * 	nwords - pointer to number of 16-bit words actually read
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	0 - all went well.
 * 	-1 - lost sync or improperly ended buffer
 * 	-2 - wait for board interrupt timed out or failed
 * 	-4 - not initialized for reading
 * 	-5 - poll for DATA_AVAIL timed out

 * Parameters:
 *
 * 	bufinfo - pointer to a struct buffer_info which will be filled in
 * 	    this function.
 * 	buf - pointer to array of bytes to read to (should be at least
 * 	    8192 bytes long).
 * 	nbytes - pointer to number of bytes actually read

 * 	according to this formula:
 *
 * 		ms = nbytes / Delay_factor
 *
 * 	This function allows the application to set the value of the

 * Returns:
