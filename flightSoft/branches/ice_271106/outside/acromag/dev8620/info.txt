	Compiling and Loading the Device Driver Module

        i)   Copy the Apc8620 device driver routines from the "dev8620"
             directory of the source media to a new directory  under
             /home/ip/dev8620.

        ii)  Create a device node in the /dev directory using
             "mknod apc8620 c 46 0".
             The command line items are as follows:
             apc8620 - Device name defined in the device driver file. 
             c       - Character device driver.
             46      - Major number defined in the device driver file.
             0       - Minor number, just 0.

        iii) Use the makefile to build the project.

        iv)  As 'root' load the module by using the insmod utility 
             "insmod /home/ip/dev8620/apc8620.o".
             When the module is loaded in single user mode the Vendor ID,
             Device ID, physical, and mapped addresses are displayed on
             the console.

        v)   Go to one of the ipxxx directories and see the infoxxx.txt
             file for information about compiling demonstration programs.
