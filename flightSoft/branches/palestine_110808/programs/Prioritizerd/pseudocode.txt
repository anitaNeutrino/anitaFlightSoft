/* 1) Pedestal subtract, promoting to int; this depends on the
physical cell and coupling in the Labrador and must be subtracted
before unwrapping (up 8 bits)
THIS IS WHERE WE MASK OUT THE WIRED OR BITS.
*/

/* 2) Unwrap the channels */ 

/* 3) Establish baselines and subtract.*/

/* 4) Build antenna and ring data structures */

/* 5) Match gains within each antenna */ 

/* 6) Do any filtering here (including FFT or matched filter if needed) 
Down to 3 bits. */ 

/* 7) Form Stokes parameters and get the linearly and total polarized 
power for each antenna. */ 

/*8) Form ring-level L2 similar to standard trigger with configurable
sector width, coincidence level, threshold vs. RMS, and resolving time
*/ 

/* 9) Form L3 and derive best estimate for nadir angle */ 

/* 10) Reconstruct the power from the reconstructed direction by coadding
antennas */
