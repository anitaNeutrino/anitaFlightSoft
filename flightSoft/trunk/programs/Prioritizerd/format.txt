FORMAT OF TEXT DATA FILE FOR PRIORITIZER DEBUGGING
--------------------------------------------------
SURF channels are separated by two blank lines
and a comment, for use with the GNUplot index
mechanism.  

Raw data is in surf channel order, indexed by surf 
channel.  

1: sample number
2: raw
3: unwrapped (zero after end)
4: baseline subtracted

There is another file for antenna level. The order is:

top ring: phi=0->15
bottom ring: phi=0>15
bicones in phi order
discones in phi order

the columns are as follows:

1: sample number
2: horizontal 
3: vertical 
4: gain matched horiz
5: gain matched vertical
6: s0
7: s1
8: s2
9: s3


There will be another file for coincidence debugging.
