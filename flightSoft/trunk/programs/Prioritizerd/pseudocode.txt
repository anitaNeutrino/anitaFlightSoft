/* 1) Pedestal subtract, promoting to int; this depends on the
physical cell and coupling in the Labrador and must be subtracted
before unwrapping (up 8 bits)*/

/* 2) Unwrap the channels */ 

/* 3) Establish baselines and subtract.*/

/* 4) Match gains within each antenna */ 

/* 5) Do any filtering here (including FFT if needed) Down to 3
bits. */ 

/* 6) Form S0,S1,S2(I,Q,U)? and get the linearly polarized power for
each antenna. */ 

/*7) Form ring-level L2 similar to standard trigger with configurable
sector width, coincidence level, threshold vs. RMS, and resolving time
*/ 

/* 8) Form L3 and derive best estimate for nadir angle */ 

/* 9) Reconstruct the power from the reconstructed direction by coadding
antennas */
