    ABSTRACT:       This module is used to perform the write output function
		    for the IP220 board.

    CALLING
        SEQUENCE:   wro220(ptr,channel,data);
                    where:
        		ptr (pointer to structure)
		            Pointer to the configuration block structure.
                        channel (unsigned short)
                            Value of the analog output channel number (0-7).
                        data (unsigned short)
                            Value of the analog output data.

    MODULES FUNCTIONAL DETAILS:

    This module is used to perform the write output function
    for the IP220 board.  A structure pointer to the board
    memory map, the analog output channel number value, and the
    analog output data value will be passed to this routine.  The routine
    writes the output data to the analog output channel register on
    the board.

/*
    ENTRY POINT OF ROUTINE:
    Write the output data to the output channel on the board.
