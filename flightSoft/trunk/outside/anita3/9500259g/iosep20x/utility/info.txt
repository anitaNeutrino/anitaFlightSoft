      HFileGenerator.c  - Source  code for the HFileGenerator  program.
      The  source  code  may  be  compiled  to  produce  an  executable
      HFileGenerator program on most operating systems.

      HFileGenerator -  This application is used to create  a 'C'  style
      '.h' source file that contains the data parsed from an 'Intel.hex'
      file.      The  resulting  '.h'  file  can  be  used  to  compile
      configuration data into the application.
      The  user   then   writes   the   contents   of  the   array   to
      the board.  The file pldcfgep20x.c expects the file 'ninek528a.h'
      ( output from  HFileGenerator )  to  be  located in  the same
      directory.

      Examine buildxxxx.bat files for command line syntax.
