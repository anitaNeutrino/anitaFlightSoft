	1. Overview

	This  "information"  file  contains a description of  the library
	programs used for the following  Acromag  Industrial  I/O  Board:

	     IOS-EP20x Boards

	2. Introduction

	The  software  for  the  IOS-EP20x I/O  board  is  implemented as
	a library of "C" functions.  This will  make  it     possible  to
	utilize the board by simply linking  the user's  code	with  the
	provided   library   and   making   function   calls   for   each
	"command"  to be accomplished.  Most of the function  calls  will
	require  a few parameters or the address of a parameter block  to
	be  passed.   The  parameters will  include  the  board  address,
	configuration  information,  data storage addresses,  and  status
	information. These functions accomplish the following tasks:

	     - Configuration
	     - Read Status and ID
	     - Read Input
	     - Write Output
	     - Change of State and Level Interrupts

	Also  included  is  a demonstration program which shows  how  the
	library routines are used.  It is also a helpful program  to  use
	when first installing the board, checking  it  out, and  learning
	how it works.

	In this document, the term "port" is used to describe a block  of
	16 channels  numbered 0 through 15.    Channels 0-15   correspond
	to port 0,  16-31 to port 1,  and 32-47  to port 2.    Individual
	channels are referred to as "points".    Points are numbered 0-15
	within an individual port.


	3. List of Files

	The  library  software  for  each  Acromag  I/O  board  is  in  a
	correspondingly  named  subdirectory  on the supplied media.  The
	files which make up the library for the IOS-EP20x
	boards are stored in the subdirectory named "iosep20x".

	There  are two types of program files provided.   Library program
	files are the files which make up the "library".  Support program
	files contain example programs which show how to use the library.

	3.1 Library Program Files

	The  following  files are included on the supplied  media  and
	make up the actual "library" software.

	     iosep20x.h  - include file
	     cnfgep20x.c - configure
	     rstsep20x.c - read status and ID
	     rpntep20x.c - read an input point
	     rprtep20x.c - read an input port
	     wpntep20x.c - write an output point
	     wprtep20x.c - write an output port
	     pldcfgep20x.c - writes PLD configuration to module 


	3.2 Support Program Files

	The  following files are included on the supplied media.   The
	test program demonstrates how  the library  programs may be used.

	     drvrep20x.c - test program to demonstrate library programs.
	     ioscarrier.h - include file for carrier support.
	     ioscarrier.c - source file for carrier support.

	     hfilegenerator.c - source for .hex to .h conversion program.
                 


	4. Software Installation

	It  is strongly advised that the user make a backup copy  of  the
	distribution  media  and  that   the  original  media  be  stored
	in a safe place.

	The  software is installed by simply copying the library files to
	the  user's  work directory and compiling and  linking  with  the
	user's application program.


	5. Hardware Installation

	For proper installation of each Acromag I/O board the user should
	refer  to  the appropriate user's manual.


	6. Usage of the Library and Support Programs

	The  software is installed  by copying the supplied files to your
	work  directory and compiling  and linking  with your application
	program.
	It  is recommended that the user read the  User's Manual for  the
	board  and  thoroughly  familiarize themselves with the hardware.
	For a new user to become familiar with the Acromag Library it may
	be  most  "straight forward"  to proceed in the following manner:

                  ii)  Copy   the  carrier   support  routines  from  the
                  "carrier" directory  of the  source  media  to  a  new
                  directory  under   /home/ios/ioscarrier. 

                  iii) Use the makefile to build the project.

                  iv)  Launch  the  debugger,  "gdb a.out"  use  the  run 
                  command start the program or ./a.out.

                  v)   The  Acromag  Demonstration  program  menu  should
                  appear  on  the  target processor's  console  terminal.

	     (Note  that the values in the menu will differ depending  on
	     your system.)

	     Following is an explanation of each menu selection:

	     1. Return to Previous Menu

	     This selection returns  the user  to the Main  Demonstration
	     Menu.

	     2. Board Pointer

	     The  board  base  address is displayed,  however,  the  base
	     address  can  only be changed through the Main Demonstration
	     Menu.   This  paramter  is  automatically	 updated  in  the
	     Configuration Block when the user selects  the  "Set   Board
	     Base  Address"  item  in	the  Main   Demonstration   Menu.

	     3. Parameter Mask

	     This  selection  allows the user to enter a  value  for  the
	     Parameter	 Mask.	 The  Parameter  Mask  is  used  by   the
	     cnfgep20x() function to determine which parameters to update
	     in  various  registers of the board.   The  individual  bits
	     correspond to various parameters in the Configuration Block.
	     A  "1"  in  the bit position means  to  use  the  respective
	     parameter  field to update a register on the board.   A  "0"
	     means not to use the parameter field.

		  bit 0  - Select Model parameter.
		  bit 1  - Interrupt Status Registers parameter.
		  bit 2  - Interrupt Enable Registers Parameter.
		  bit 3  - Interrupt Polarity Registers Parameter.
		  bit 4  - Interrupt Type Registers Parameter.
		  bit 5  - Interrupt Vector Register Parameter.
		  bit 6  - Data Direction Register Parameter.
		  bit 7  - Module Reset Parameter.

	     4. Select Model

	     This  selection  allows the user to enter a value  that will
	     select the model I/O mix.

                      Model              Value
                  -------------          -----
                  Uninitialized            0      (power up default)
                  iosep202/4               1      (24 differential/24 LVDS)
                  iosep203                 2      (24 TTL & 12 diff)
                  iosep201                 3      (48 TTL )










                                   7





	     5. Interrupt Status

	     This  selection  allows the user to enter a  value  for  the
	     Interrupt	 Status   Register.   This  register is typically
	     written  to by an interrupt  handler  routine  to  clear  an
	     interrupt  after  the  interrupt  input  stimulus  has  been
	     removed.	The user may access the  register  here  in order
	     to see its function.  A "1" in any bit position  will  clear
	     the corresponding  interrupt input bit.  A  "0"  in  any bit
	     position will have no effect.

	     6. Interrupt Enable

	     This  selection  allows the user to enter a  value  for  the
	     Interrupt	 Enable  Register.   Each  bit	 corresponds   to
	     an interrupt input point in the enable register.	 A "1" in
	     any bit position will allow interrupts to  be  generated  by
	     the corresponding point.	 A  "0"  disables  interrupts for
	     the  corresponding  interrupt  input  point.

	     7. Interrupt Polarity

	     This  selection  allows the user to enter a  value  for  the
	     Interrupt  Polarity  Register.   A value of  "0"  in  a  bit
	     position  allows  an  interrupt  to  be   generated  when  a
	     corresponding input point is below the threshold.    A value
	     of "1" in a bit position allows an interrupt to be generated
	     when a corresponding input point  is  above  the  threshold.

	     8. Interrupt Type

	     This  selection  allows  the user to enter a value  for  the
	     Interrupt Type Register.  A "0" in a bit position  means  an
	     interrupt  will be  generated when  the corresponding  input
	     channel level specified by the  interrupt polarity  register
	     occurs.   A "1" in a bit position means an interrupt will be
	     generated when the corresponding input channel changes state.

	     9. Data Direction

	     This selection allows the user to enter a value for the Data
	     Direction Register.   A "0" in a bit position configures the
	     I/O bit as an input bit.  A "1" in a bit position configures
	     the I/O bit as an output bit.   Note: Direction control bits
	     vary with the model number selected, see instruction manual.

	     10. Interrupt Vector

	     This  selection  allows  the user to enter a value  for  the
	     exception vector.

	     11. Module Reset

	     This  selection  allows  the  user  to enter a Module Reset
	     flag.   A  value of "1" will causes a reset of the  module.
	     A value of "0" means do not reset the module.

	7. Description of Library Programs.

	Following  are descriptions of the programs and files which  make
	up the library.

	iosep20x.h - This module contains the definitions and  structures
	used by the library.

	cnfgep20x.c  -  This  module   performs   the   "Configure Board"
	function for the iosep20x board.   A pointer to the Configuration
	Block is passed to this routine.  The routine  will use a pointer
	within the Configuration Block to  reference the registers on the
	board.  Based on flag bits in the  Parameter  Mask  word  in  the
	Configuration Block, the board  will be  configured  and  various
	registers will be  updated  with  new information which  will  be
	transfered from the Configuration Block.

	  calling sequence:

	     cnfgep20x(ptr);

	     where:
		  ptr  - (structure  pointer)  This is a pointer  to  the
		  Configuration Block structure.


	rstsep20x.c  - This module is used to  perform  the  "Read Status
	and ID" function for the iosep20x board.  A pointer to the Status
	Block  is  passed to this routine.  The routine  uses  a  pointer

	pldcfgep20x.c  -   This   module   is   used   to   initiate  the
	configuration of the PLD  and  test it's  success by  reading the
	model  code  byte  from  the  ID PROM.    If  the PLD  is already
	configured and in user mode  then  the re-enable  code is written
	to place the PLD  into configuration mode.  The PLD  will then be
	re-configured.


	  calling sequence:

             status = PLDConfig(c_blk);

             Where:
                  c_blk (pointer to structure)

	8. Description of Support Programs

	Following  is  a  description of the support  files  and  program
	modules  which  provide  examples  for  the  use  of  the library
	programs.

	ioscarrier.c - This  file  provides  carrier  support   routines.

	drvrep20x.c  - This is a program which demonstrates the usage  of
	the library modules.   This program is menu driven and allows the
	user to become familiar with the  iosep20x board  and the library
	software.   The user may,  through menu  selections,   configure,
	read from and write to the board.

	hfilegenerator.c - Source  code for  the  hfilegenerator program.
	The  source  code  may  be  compiled  to  produce  an  executable
	hfilegenerator program on  most  operating  systems.
	The  user  could  modify this  routine to write the  data  stream
	directly to the iosep20x module.
