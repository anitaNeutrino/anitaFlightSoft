Title: SIP COMmuncation library

sipcom is a library of C functions that takes care of
communicating with the Long Duration Balloon SIP package of the NSBF
(http://www.nsbf.nasa.gov).

We use the following SIP services:
	- transfers science commands from the ground
	- transfers ``high rate'' data from the science payload to the
	  ground at rates up to 6000 bits/second via TDRSS.
	- transfers ``low rate'' data at a rate of 255 bytes every 30
	  seconds via TDRSS or Iridium.
	- provides GPS time, position, and pressure/altitude to the science
	  payload.

Cabling:

Communicating with the SIP requires three (3) serial lines.

When using the SIP simulator, each cable has a 9-pin RS-232 connector on
each end. The pins are connected as in the diagram below. For the actual
SIP, I am not sure.

>     2 ___________    ___________ 2
>                  \  /
>                   \/     
>                   /\      
>     3 ___________/  \___________ 3
>                   
>     5 __________________________ 5

ANITA notes:

	The three serial lines are set up as follows

	- /dev/ttyS0 (com1) connects to SIP COMM1 port.
	- /dev/ttyS1 (com2) connects to SIP COMM2 port.
	- /dev/ttyS2 (com3) connects to SIP high rate TDRSS port.

	On the ANITA SBS flight computer, the following command must be
	run at boot time. I put it in /etc/rc.local. It puts the third
	serial line at the correct IRQ.
>		/bin/setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 11

	Also, the bios settings must be changed on the "peripheral
	setup" page:

>               Desc                    orig    now
>               OnBoard Serial Port 1   Auto    3F8h
>               "       "      "    2   Auto    2F8h
>               "       "      "    3   Auto    3E8h,IRQ11
>               "       "      "    4   Auto    Auto
 

Callback functions:

If you want to do anything when sipcom parses input from the SIP, you must
provide callback functions. The callbacks are code that you provide, and
that sipcom will execute whenever it parses
	- a command from the ground
	- a request for low-rate data
	- SIP gps position
	- SIP gps time
	- SIP altitude/pressure

If you do not provide a callback for a particular item, then sipcom will
take no action when it encounters it.

Compiling:

Since sipcom uses the pthreads library, you must link using -lpthread.

Example code:

See the file driver.c in the source distribution. It should contain
examples of all, I hope, functions in the library.
