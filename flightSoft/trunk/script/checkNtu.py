This script should run on the flight computer, regularly ping the NTU computer and if
it gets no response, will send a command to toggle the relays to the NTU computer and SSD drives 
off then on.

Apparently the best way to do this is power off the computer first (12V) then the SSDs (5V)
then power on the SSDs then the computer.

The flight computer should push to the ntu with rsync.
