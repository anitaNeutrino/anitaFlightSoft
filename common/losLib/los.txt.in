Title: LOS telemetry library
    Version @VERSION@ 

General information.

liblos is a library of C functions that takes care of transferring data via
the LOS telemetry board designed by Paul Dowkontt of Washington U. The
board is based on the PLX 9030. The kernel module supplied by PLX must be
loaded into the kernel and the plx device file created.

Section: Compiling and installation.
    Building the library and applications.

PLX libraries:
    The PLX libraries and header files are expected to be installed under
    /usr/local/PlxLinux. If this is not the case, edit the Makefile and
    change the PLX_SDK_DIR variable.

Compiling the library:
    To compile the library, run "make". This should create liblos.a.

Compiling the demo program:
    To compile the demo program, run "make demo". This should create a
    program called "demo".

Installing the library:
    Run "make install".

    By default, liblos will be installed in /pkgs/liblos-VERSION. If you
    don't like this, change the PREFIX variable. There is one for
    /usr/local that you can uncomment. The los.h header file will installed
    in $(PREFIX)/include and liblos.a in $(PREFIX)/lib when "make install"
    is run.

Compiling and linking an application:
    Try something like this:

>	gcc -DGCC  -DPCI_CODE -DPLX_LITTLE_ENDIAN -DPLX_LINUX 
>	-I/usr/local/PlxLinux/include
>	-I/usr/local/PlxLinux/linux/samples/common
>	-Wall -pipe -g -o myapp myapp.c -llos
>	/usr/local/PlxLinux/linux/api/Library/PlxApi.a
>	/usr/local/PlxLinux/linux/PciDrvApi/Library/PciDrvApi.a

    The relevant Makefile sections for the demo program would look like this.
    I know it's ugly.

>	PLX_SDK_DIR = /usr/local/PlxLinux
>	COMMON_DIR = $(PLX_SDK_DIR)/linux/samples/common
>	INCLUDE_DIR = $(PLX_SDK_DIR)/include
>	INCLUDE = -I. -I$(INCLUDE_DIR) -I$(COMMON_DIR)
>	
>	DEFS = -DGCC  -DPCI_CODE -DPLX_LITTLE_ENDIAN -DPLX_LINUX
>	OPTS = -Wall -pipe -g
>	CC = gcc
>	CFLAGS = $(DEFS) $(INCLUDE) $(OPTS)
>	
>	LIBS = $(PLX_SDK_DIR)/linux/api/Library/PlxApi.a \
>		$(PLX_SDK_DIR)/linux/PciDrvApi/Library/PciDrvApi.a
>	
>	demo:	demo.c liblos.a los.h
>		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o demo demo.c -llos $(LIBS) -lncurses

Section: Example code
    How do you do it?

See the file demo.c in the source distribution. It provides a simple
interactive interface to the LOS board and should demonstrate how to
exercise all the library functions.

Section: Data format
    Format of data sent to and received from the boards.

Data sent to <los_write()>:

The only restriction that liblos imposes on the format of "science" data
passed to it is that the number of bytes not exceed <LOS_MAX_BYTES>, equal
to 8100 bytes (as of 3 Aug '05). Other than that, liblos treats the input
science data as an arbitrary sequence of bytes. This sequence of bytes is
transferred to an application on the ground embedded in a few headers as
documented below.

Data returned by <los_read()>:

The data returned by <los_read()> has the following format.
See also the <Macros> <START_HDR>, <AUX_HDR>, <SW_START_HDR>,
<SW_END_HDR>, <END_HDR>, and <AUX_HDR>.


> byte    word
> offset  offset     value   description
>
>  0        0        0xF00D  START_HDR
>  2        1        0xD0CC  AUX_HDR
>  4        2        0xAE00  SW_START_HDR
>  6        3                Buffer count
>  8        4        N       Number of bytes of science data
> 10        5        NB      Science data (NB = N + (N%2) bytes).
> ...       ...                If N is an odd number, then a fill byte
> ...       ...	               with value 0xDA is added to the end.
> 10+NB     5+(NB/2)         Checksum
> 12+NB     6+(NB/2) 0xAEFF  SW_END_HDR
> 14+NB     7+(NB/2) 0xC0FE  END_HDR
> 16+NB     8+(NB/2) 0xD0CC  AUX_HDR

Regarding the number of science data bytes, if the number N is an odd
number, then an additional byte <FILL_BYTE> is added to the end.

Section: Basic lab setup
    Hardware and software details.

Hardware:

Put the cPCI board in the flight computer. You will have to note which pci
bus and slot it is in and pass these parameters to <los_init()>.

Put the regular PCI board in the GSE computer. If this is the only PLX
board in the computer, then you can give <los_init()> parameters of -1 for
bus and slot, and the PLX driver will find the board. Otherwise, if there
are other PLX boards, you will have to note the bus and slot as above.

Connect the cable labeled "DATA" into the correspondingly labeled screw-in
connector on the flight telemetry board. Do the same for the cable labeled
"CLK".

Connect the DB9 connector into the GSE telemetry board.

Software:

On the flight computer, run the demo program. It is an interactive program
that allows you to the boards using the liblos routines.

    - press "i" to initialize liblos. It will prompt you for bus, slot,
      whether to use interrupts or polling, whether to write or read, and
      the number of milliseconds to delay between polls.
  
For now, use polling rather than interrupts, and leave the delay at the
default of 100 ms by entering -1. The flight end should be set for writing.

    - press "a" to select the number of 16-bit words of data you want to
      transfer.

    - press "W" to write and transfer one buffer of data.

    - press "w" to continually transfer buffers. Another keypress will stop
      the transfers.

Do the same on the GSE computer, except set it to read mode instead of
write, and

    - press "R" to read a single buffer.

    - press "r" to read continually. Another keypress will stop reading.

IMPORTANT: If things don't seem to be working, first try pressing the reset
button on the board after power up. Eventually, we hope to have a
software-activated reset.

There is also a lower level interactive program called telem_test that I
can send you if you think you need it. It does not use liblos, but does
provide more direct access to the telemetry boards, and can be useful for
debugging.
